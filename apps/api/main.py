"""StreamKit API — routes only.

Persistence lives in `store`, WebSocket bookkeeping in `hub`, and the shape of
everything that reaches a browser in `events`. This module is the HTTP surface
and nothing else; the split exists so that adding a widget or an event source
does not mean editing the file that owns routing.
