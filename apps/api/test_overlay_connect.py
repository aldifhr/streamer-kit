"""The overlay must reach a stream without a login, and nothing else may.

`POST /api/connect` takes the room to connect from the request body, so it aims
the one global room wherever the caller says. That cannot be public. OBS loads
`/overlay/<id>` on the streamer's machine and cannot log in, so the overlay has
to have some way to reach the room — which is what `/api/overlay-connect/<id>`
is, and it takes no body: the username comes from the overlay's saved config.

These assert that distinction holds, because the failure mode of getting it
wrong is silent. The overlay simply never connects and the streamer watches a
sample scene; nothing in that looks like a security failure, which is how the
public `/api/connect` could have looked fine while letting anyone repoint the
stream.
