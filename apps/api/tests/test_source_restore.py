"""A backend restart should not kill every live stream.

The channel each overlay is aimed at was already stored per overlay — it is what
the editor writes — so the data needed to come back was sitting there and nothing
read it at boot. A restart therefore left every live stream silent until somebody
noticed and called the reconnect endpoint by hand, which on the day this was
written is exactly what happened.

Two things are worth being careful about and neither is the happy path:

- One room that refuses to come back must not stop the others, and must not take
  the API down with it. A backend that cannot start is a backend nobody can reach
  to fix the one that would not connect.
- An overlay with no channel must be skipped quietly. Most overlays have no
  channel, and logging them would bury the ones that matter.

Run with the backend's interpreter:

    apps/api/.venv/bin/python apps/api/tests/test_source_restore.py
